# Introduction

This is my actual dotfiles that I use all day long for all kind of
stuff, for working and for personal projects. I've decided to make
everything install manually because I don't like to use another software
to install my default configuration. All of this configuration is main
focused on macOS, but could be adapted for another uses, like linux (but
I think nothing of this will makes sense on Windows, sorry).
Feel free to explore all my configuration and get what you feel makes
sense to you! :^)
