# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# 
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

# 
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style. If you set
# the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style
# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled
# font style, the regular font style will be used instead.

# Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style is
# not available in the specified font-family.
# 
# Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font
# does not have a specific style. For bold, this is done by drawing an
# outline around the glyph of varying thickness. For italic, this is done by
# applying a slant to the glyph. For bold italic, both of these are applied.
# 
# Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good
# as a font that has the style natively. However, they are useful to
# provide styled text when the font does not have the style.
# 
# Set this to "false" or "true" to disable or enable synthetic styles
# completely. You can disable specific styles using "no-bold", "no-italic",
# and "no-bold-italic". You can disable multiple styles by separating them
# with a comma. For example, "no-bold,no-italic".
# 
# Available style keys are: `bold`, `italic`, `bold-italic`.
# 
# If synthetic styles are disabled, then the regular style will be used
# instead if the requested style is not available. If the font has the
# requested style, then the font will be used as-is since the style is
# not synthetic.
# 
# Warning! An easy mistake is to disable `bold` or `italic` but not
# `bold-italic`. Disabling only `bold` or `italic` will NOT disable either
# in the `bold-italic` style. If you want to disable `bold-italic`, you must
# explicitly disable it. You cannot partially disable `bold-italic`.

#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
# 
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
# 
# Note that the fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
# 
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# 
# Warning: if you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
# 
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
# 
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
# 
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
# 
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
# 
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
# 
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
# 
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
# 
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
# 
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
# 
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
# 
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
# 
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Some notes for the action:
# 
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
# 
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
# 
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
# 
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
# 
#   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#     keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#     then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#     applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#     are already global (i.e. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
# 
#   * `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#     within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#     sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#     globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#     specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#     work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#     information.
# 
#   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
#     will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
#     any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
#     you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
#     `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
#     `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and `all:`-prefixed
#     keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
#     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
#     they're never encoded.
# 
# Keybind trigger are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
# 
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
# 
# A note on `global:`: this feature is only supported on macOS. On macOS,
# this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
# When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
# Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
# not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
# permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still

#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The

# Sets the reporting format for OSC sequences that request color information.
# Ghostty currently supports OSC 10 (foreground), OSC 11 (background), and
# OSC 4 (256 color palette) queries, and by default the reported values
# are scaled-up RGB values, where each component are 16 bits. This is how
# most terminals report these values. However, some legacy applications may
# require 8-bit, unscaled, components. We also support turning off reporting
# altogether. The components are lowercase hex values.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - OSC 4/10/11 queries receive no reply
# 
#   * `8-bit` - Color components are return unscaled, i.e. `rr/gg/bb`
# 
#   * `16-bit` - Color components are returned scaled, e.g. `rrrr/gggg/bbbb`

# 
# WARNING: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by
# causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can
# unset this configuration to disable the shader.
# 
# On Linux, this requires OpenGL 4.2. Ghostty typically only requires
# OpenGL 3.3, but custom shaders push that requirement up to 4.2.
# 
# The shader API is identical to the Shadertoy API: you specify a `mainImage`
# function and the available uniforms match Shadertoy. The iChannel0 uniform
# is a texture containing the rendered terminal screen.
# 
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).
# 
# This can be repeated multiple times to load multiple shaders. The shaders
# will be run in the order they are specified.
# 
# Changing this value at runtime and reloading the configuration will only
# affect new windows, tabs, and splits.

# If `true` (default), the focused terminal surface will run an animation
# loop when custom shaders are used. This uses slightly more CPU (generally
# less than 10%) but allows the shader to animate. This only runs if there
# are custom shaders and the terminal is focused.
# 
# If this is set to `false`, the terminal and custom shader will only render
# when the terminal is updated. This is more efficient but the shader will
# not animate.
# 
# This can also be set to `always`, which will always run the animation
# loop regardless of whether the terminal is focused or not. The animation
# loop will still only run when custom shaders are used. Note that this
# will use more CPU per terminal surface and can become quite expensive
# depending on the shader and your terminal usage.
# 
# This value can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently
# open terminals.

# If anything other than false, fullscreen mode on macOS will not use the
# native fullscreen, but make the window fullscreen without animations and
# using a new space. It's faster than the native fullscreen mode since it
# doesn't use animations.
# 
# Important: tabs DO NOT WORK in this mode. Non-native fullscreen removes
# the titlebar and macOS native tabs require the titlebar. If you use tabs,
# you should not use this mode.
# 
# If you fullscreen a window with tabs, the currently focused tab will
# become fullscreen while the others will remain in a separate window in
# the background. You can switch to that window using normal window-switching
# keybindings such as command+tilde. When you exit fullscreen, the window
# will return to the tabbed state it was in before.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `visible-menu` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, keep the menu bar visible
#   * `true` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar
#   * `false` - Use native macOS fullscreen

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
# 
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
# 
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
# 
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
# 
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways. The top titlebar area of the window will
# continue to drag the window around and you will not be able to use
# the mouse for terminal events in this space.
# 
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# 
# The default value is `visible`.
# 
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently

# reading keyboard events. This can always be enabled manually using the
# `Ghostty > Secure Keyboard Entry` menu item.
# 
# Note that automatic password prompt detection is based on heuristics
# and may not always work as expected. Specifically, it does not work
# over SSH connections, but there may be other cases where it also
# doesn't work.

# with legitimate accessibility software (or software that uses the
# accessibility APIs), since secure input prevents any application from
# reading keyboard events.

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
# 
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
# 
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
